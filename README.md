# EmojiDisplayer

This project is my first hands into SWIFT code. It howcases the power of SwiftUI in creating interactive and user-friendly interfaces with minimal code. It is centered around a playful emoji selection experience, where users can pick their favorite emoji from a curated list.

## Features

- **Emoji Selection**: Users can tap to select an emoji from a diverse palette that includes a dragon (🐉), an old man (👨🏻‍🦳), a monocle face (🧐), and an orangutan (🦧).
- **Large Display**: Selected emoji is displayed prominently at the top of the screen in a large font size for clear visibility.
- **Custom Picker**: A custom emoji picker interface is used, utilizing SwiftUI's `.pickerStyle(.palette)` for a smooth selection experience.
- **Navigation View**: Encapsulated in a `NavigationView` with the title "We Love Emojis!" providing a clear context for the app's purpose.
- **State Management**: Uses `@State` property wrapper to manage the state of the selected emoji, ensuring the UI stays responsive and up-to-date with user interactions.
